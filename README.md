Post-Processing Utilities
=========================

This repository contains some small utility scripts for
[the post-processing stack][PostProcessing].

PostProcessingController
------------------------

**PostProcessingController** provides a simple interface to modify the settings
of the post-processing stack. It exposes all the settings and enable/disable
flags as public members. These members can be directly modified from the
inspector, scripts and animations.

It creates a clone of the profile when starting the Play mode, and thus it can
avoid modifying the profile asset with changes. This is similar to
[`Renderer.material`][RendererMaterial] that automatically creates a clone of
a material on changes.

FocusPuller
-----------

**FocusPuller** automatically updates the focus distance of the depth of field
effect depending on the distance from the camera to a target object.

It usesÂ PostProcessingController to update the distance value dynamically.
